# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project is a **pet project for data analysis practice** using a sales dataset from a hypothetical company. The goal is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, test business hypotheses, build simple predictive models, and extract valuable insights from the data.


## Key Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preparation**
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
- Test business hypotheses
- Build a **simple linear regression model** to predict sales based on order quantity
- Evaluate model performance using RÂ², MAE, and MSE metrics
- Investigate additional insights:
  - Impact of discounts on sales
  - Top-performing customers
  - Monthly sales dynamics
  - Correlation heatmap for numerical features

---

## Hypotheses Tested
1. **Higher discount rates lead to increased sales volume.**
2. **Sales are higher in certain months (seasonality).**
3. **A linear relationship exists between quantity ordered and total sales.**
4. **Certain product lines generate more revenue than others.**
